```A powerful, modern, and friendly wrapper for JavaScript dates and times.
DateTimes, Durations, and Intervals
Immutable, chainable, unambiguous API.

# 2kB
Less JavaScript to download, parse and execute, leaving more time for your code.

# Simple
Day.js is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API.
If you use Moment.js, you already know how to use Day.js.

# Immutable
All API operations that change the Day.js object will return a new instance instead.
This helps prevent bugs and avoid long debugging sessions.

# I18n
Day.js has great support for internationalization. But none of them will be included in your build unless you use them.
